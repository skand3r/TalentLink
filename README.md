TalentLink – A Simple Job Matching Platform


TalentLink is a web application that connects job seekers with individuals or businesses looking for help. Users can sign in as either:

Job Posters – create and manage job listings

Workers – browse available jobs and apply to tasks that match their skills

Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Node.js, TalentLink is designed to be a lightweight and extensible platform for experimenting with user roles, dynamic job listings, and NoSQL database interactions using MongoDB.
